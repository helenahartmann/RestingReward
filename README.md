# RestingReward
For this project we will use resting-state fMRI data of the Human Connectome Young Adult Project to predict individual differences in reward sensitivity. Data analyses will include ICA and complementary measures of seed-based functional connectivity, and relation of these measures to reward sensitivity (e.g., delay discounting).
